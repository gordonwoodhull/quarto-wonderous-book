# Introduction {#sec-intro}

This is the first chapter of the book.

## Section 1.1

Some content in section 1.1. See @fig-cars for an example figure.

```{r}
#| label: fig-cars
#| fig-cap: "A plot of the cars dataset"
plot(cars)
```

## Section 1.2

Some content in section 1.2. See @fig-visualization for an embedded notebook figure.

{{< embed notebooks/computations.ipynb#fig-visualization >}}

We will discuss methods in @sec-methods.

## Section 1.3 - Callouts

::: {.callout-note}
The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't. This is a note callout without a custom title.
:::

::: {#wrn-tea .callout-warning}
## Whose Tea Is This?
On no account allow anyone to make you a conditions-affected beverage. The alarm on Arthur Dent's alarm clock had been going off for several hours when he finally woke up. See @wrn-tea to reference this warning.
:::

## Section 1.4 - Custom Crossref Dinosaurs

This section tests custom cross-reference types using the user-defined "Dinosaur" category.

::: {#dino-steg}
**Stegosaurus**

This is the first dinosaur in Chapter 1, a herbivore with distinctive plates. See @dino-steg to self-reference.
:::

::: {#dino-trex}
**Tyrannosaurus Rex**

This is the second dinosaur in Chapter 1, the king of predators. See @dino-trex to self-reference, or @dino-steg for the first dinosaur.
:::

## Section 1.5 - Equations

The fundamental equation of special relativity:

$$
E = mc^2
$$ {#eq-einstein}

As shown in @eq-einstein, energy and mass are equivalent.

Another important equation:

$$
F = ma
$$ {#eq-newton}

Newton's second law (@eq-newton) relates force to acceleration.

## Section 1.6 - Theorems

::: {#thm-pythagorean}
## Pythagorean Theorem
For a right triangle with legs $a$ and $b$ and hypotenuse $c$: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$
:::

See @thm-pythagorean for the classic result.

::: {#lem-triangle}
## Triangle Inequality
For any triangle with sides $a$, $b$, and $c$: $a + b > c$
:::

See @lem-triangle for the inequality.

## Section 1.7 - Code Listings

```{#lst-hello .python lst-cap="Hello World in Python"}
def hello():
    print("Hello, World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    hello()
```

See @lst-hello for a simple Python example.

```{#lst-fibonacci .python lst-cap="Fibonacci Sequence"}
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

The Fibonacci function (@lst-fibonacci) uses recursion.
