This is the third chapter of the book.

## Cross-chapter references

In this chapter, we reference figures from previous chapters to demonstrate cross-chapter sub-figure references.

Recall the panel figure from @sec-methods: see @fig-panel for the complete panel. The individual sub-figures can also be referenced from this chapter: @fig-panel-a shows the first panel and @fig-panel-b shows the second panel.

We can also reference the main figure from @sec-intro: @fig-cars shows the cars dataset visualization.

## Cross-chapter callout references

We can reference callouts from previous chapters:

- See @wrn-tea for the tea warning from @sec-intro
- See @tip-towel for towel advice from @sec-methods
- See @nte-vogon for important information about Vogon poetry
